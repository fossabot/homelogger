# Policy for AI-Generated Code

## Introduction and Purpose

This policy outlines the guidelines for using Artificial Intelligence (AI) generated code within this repository. As AI tools become increasingly common, we aim to ensure transparency and maintain code quality. 

This policy applies to all contributors and maintainers of this repository. It is designed to promote responsible use of AI-generated code while ensuring that all contributions meet our standards for quality, originality, and compliance with licensing requirements.

## What is AI-Generated Code

Any code, snippet, configuration, documentation, or other programmatic asset produced, suggested, or significantly modified by an AI model, tool, or service (e.g., GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude Code, etc.). Code that is directly used or heavily adapted from AI output qualifies as AI-generated.

## Transparency and Disclosure

All contributors must disclose the use of AI tools when submitting AI-generated code.

**Explicit Attribution**: When a Pull Request (PR) or commit includes nontrivial or substantial AI-generated content (e.g., functions, methods, classes, or multi-file changes), indicate this in the commit message and PR description. You must specify the AI tool used and the extent of its contribution. For example:

```
This PR includes code generated with GitHub Copilot, which contributed approximately 50% of the new code in this PR. 

These files contain code substantially generated by AI tools:
- client/src/components/ExampleComponent.js
- server/cmd/api/ExampleHandler.go

By submitting this code, I confirm that I have reviewed and understand the AI-generated content and that it complies with our licensing and quality standards.
```

**Originality**: If AI was used only for brainstorming, refactoring, or inspiration, and the final code is substantially original and reviewed by the contributor, a general disclosure in the PR description is sufficient.

## Licensing and Copyright

Contributors are responsible for ensuring AI-generated code complies with this project's license and Red Hat's copyright and AI guidelines. Do not assume AI-generated code is free from copyright obligations. Treat it with the same diligence as third-party code. If there's a risk of training data leakage or unclear licensing, investigate or rewrite the code before submission.

## Code Quality, Review, and Testing

AI-generated code must meet the same quality, testing, and review standards as human-written code.

* **Human Review Required**: *All* AI-generated code must be reviewed and understood by the contributor and reviewers.
* **Understanding is Key**: Do not submit code you cannot explain, modify, or debug yourself.
* **Iterative Refinement**: AI tools are assistants, not replacements for human judgment.

## Enforcement and Dispute Resolution

Non-compliance with this policy may result in PR changes or rejection. Questions or concerns about AI-generated contributions will be discussed and resolved by the maintainers.

## Disclaimer

This policy is a living document and will be updated as AI technology evolves and best practices emerge. Contributors are encouraged to provide feedback and suggestions to improve this policy over time.
