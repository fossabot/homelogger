## 🚦 The "Before You Code" Rule

To keep the project focused and maintainable, we have specific rules regarding Pull Requests:

### 🛠️ Bug Fixes
* **Unsolicited PRs:** Generally accepted! If you find a bug and have a fix, feel free to submit a PR.
* **Process:** We strongly recommend discussing the bug in a **GitHub Issue** first to ensure the fix aligns with our architecture.

### ✨ New Features
* **Unsolicited PRs:** **Please do not submit a PR for a new feature without prior approval.**
* **Process:** If you have an idea for a feature, please open a [Feature Request/Discussion] first. I will only accept PRs for features that I have explicitly indicated I am willing to merge. 
* **Why?** This prevents you from wasting time on a feature that may not fit the project's long-term roadmap.

### 💬 General Feedback & Questions
* All general feedback, "How-to" questions, or non-technical ideas should be kept in **GitHub Discussions**.

## 🤖 AI-Generated Code Policy

We value human oversight. If you use AI tools (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.), you must follow these rules:

1.  **Verification:** You must read and understand every line of the code you submit. Do not submit code you cannot explain.
2.  **Disclosure:** You must explicitly identify AI-generated code in your Pull Request. 
3.  **Labeling:** Use the following snippet in your PR description:
    > **AI Disclosure:** This PR contains code generated by [Tool Name]. I have reviewed the entirety of the code and verified its logic.

*Failure to disclose AI usage or submitting unverified code is grounds for immediate PR rejection.*

## 🚀 Pull Request Process

1.  **Check for an Issue:** Ensure there is an existing Issue or Discussion for your work.
2.  **Fork & Branch:** Create a branch from `main`.
3.  **Tests:** Ensure all existing tests pass and add new ones if applicable.
4.  **Describe:** Clearly explain what your PR does and link to the relevant Issue.

## 🎨 Style & Standards
* Follow the existing code style and naming conventions.
* Keep commits clean and descriptive.
* [Add specific linting/formatting commands here]

**Note:** Quality is prioritized over quantity. I would much rather see one well-documented bug fix than five unrequested features!
